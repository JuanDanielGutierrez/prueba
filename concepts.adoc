== What is a test?
* Specifies how your software is intended to work
* Can be run against your software to verify it

== Why test?
* Increase:
** Trust
** Confidence
* You will never be 100% confident!
* But you can be 60% confident.

== Types of tests
* Specifying and running test for everything is:
** Hard to maintain
** Slow
** Hard to write

* Unit tests
** Test 'isolated units'
*** e.g. a method or function
** Super high coverage
** Most of the tests
* Integration tests
** Combine units and test them together
** Fill in the cracks between the tests
* System tests
** Test with everything plugged together and configured as expected
** From the end user's perspective
* Acceptance tests
** Test the customer's use cases

== Coverage
* Statement coverage == "Was this line executed?"
* Decision coverage == "Was this code path executed?"
* Condition coverage == "Was every part of the decision executed?"

== Unit Tests
* *People often love or hate unit tests.*
* But they are neutral, like brushing your teeth

== What are unit tests good for?
* Finding bugs DURING development
* A design tool
* Writing maintainable code
* Documenting a developer's intentions
* Running quickly

== What are unit tests not good for?
* Finding bugs
* Indicating that your application is functioning correctly
* Testing glue code
* Testing every possible permutation

WARNING: Unit tests ARE NOT for preventing bugs

IMPORTANT: Unit tests ARE for writing clean maintainable code with confidence

== Generating tests cases
* Think about possible input
* Categorize the input into special cases
* One test per special case

== Trusting sources of input
* What if the wrong type of data is passed in?
* What if the sequence is extremely large?
* Depends:
** Where the input is coming from
** Where you implement validation

== Python Unit Testing

=== *unittest* module
* Comes with the standard library
* Typically will do basically everything you need
* `self.assertEqual(result, "cats")`

=== *pytest* module
* `$ pip install pytest`
* Provides everything that *unittest* does but with more batteries included!
* Less boilerplate thanks to magical fixtures.
* Assertions are more natural and do not require custom invocation.
* `assert result == "cats"`

== pytest
*pytest* will treat any function whose name starts with *test_* a test.
Same goes for test modules.

We can use plain old Python *assert* to test.

== Unit Test Structure
. Define your inputs and any preconditions
. Invoke the thing.
. Verify that it did what you expected.

TL;DR a test is an easy way to quantify what it means for your thing to "work".

[source, python]
----
def reverse(items):
  return items[::-1]

def test_reverse_works_with_string():
  assert reverse('abc') == 'cba'

def test_reverse_works_with_list():
  assert reverse([1, 2, 3]) == [3, 2, 1]
----

== PEP8
* It's a coding standard
* Prescribes things like:
** < 80 character lines
** 2 new lines between functions in a module
** 1 new line between methods in a class
** Visual indentation rules
** ..and more!
* PEP8 isn't the only standard out there! (see Google's Python Style Guide)
* Main thing is to be consistent with the codebase
* Our tests will fail if py.test finds any PEP8 violations

== Test Automation
* You should run your tests regularly!
* Tests that don't run are not trusted

== Other Testable Aspects
* Sometimes it's also worth adding other checks to your testing pipeline.
* _Static Analysis_ Done entirely offline - without running your code
* *Cyclomatic Complexity*
** A measure of how complex function is
** Checks that functions "*aren't too complex*"
** `$ pip install pytest-mccabe`
* *PEP8*
** Checks for PEP8 compliance
** `$ pip install pytest-pep8`
* *Pyflakes*
** Checks for syntax errors
** `$ pip install pytest-flakes`
* You can have these run before your tests in order to fail fast!

== Trusting sources of input
* What if we didn't trust the input?

== Generating test cases
* < 0
* 0
* Fraction of a year
* Most ages
* > 1000
* Wrong data type
* NaN

== pytest - Testing for exceptions
* pytest.raises

[source, python]
----
import pytest

with pytest.raises(TypeError):
  '2' + 2
----

== pytest - fixtures
Fixtures are a way to define reusable components that are required by your tests.
*Pytest* will automagically hook up your fixtures to your tests (or other fixtures!) that require them.

[source, python]
----
import pytest

@pytest.fixture
def cool_stuff():
  return CoolStuff()

def test_the_things(cool_stuff):
  assert cool_stuff.is_cool == True
----

By default, fixtures are recreated for every test that requires them.

It is possible to control the lifetime of a fixture (e.g. create it once for all the tests), but that is out of scope for today!

== Unit testing and state of the outside world
* What if you want to test functionality that:
** Uses the current time/sleeps
** Depends on an external service (e.g. an HTTP server or DB)
** Uses random
* Super easy in Python

== Mocking
* Create "mock" objects that mimic the external objects/functions
* You can control their behaviour completely!
** Return whatever time you want
** Pretend to sleep
** Return fake DB or HTTP results
** Return deterministic results instead of random
* Verify arguments used
* Verify that everything is plugged together correctly
** Test the true behaviour later with system tests
* *mock* module included in the Python 3 standard library

[source, python]
----
import mock

obj = mock.MagickMock()

value = obj[5]

value = obj.foo()

obj.foo.call_count
----

== Patching
* Replace methods/classes/modules with mock objects
* Clean up automatically at the end of a test

== Patching with pytest
* pytest-mock
** `pip install pytest-mock`
** Wrapper around the mock library the works well with pytest

[source, python]
----
import time

def time_message():
  return f"Time is ${time.time()}"

def test_time_message(mocker):
  mocked_time = mocker.patch.object(time, 'time', autospec=True)
  mocked_time.return_value = 7
  assert time_message() == "Time is 7"
----

== Mock and Patch - autospec
* Make sure that the expected interface is being
** Raises if methods or attributes are used that don't exist
* Always use autospec!
[source, python]
----
mocked_time = mocker.patch.object(time, 'time', autospec=True)
----

== Parameterization - condensing tests
* `cat_years_to_hooman_years`
* What if we want to test for more bad input?
** So many more tests to write!
[source, python]
----
@pytest.mark.parametrize("age", [
  "five",
  [3, 4],
  {2: 3},
  (),
  1000.1,
  -4
])
def test__cat_years_to_hooman_years__bad_input__raises(age):
  with pytest.raises(safecatmath.InvalidAge):
    safecatmath.cat_years_to_hooman_years(age)
----

== Parametrization of fixtures
* Fixtures can be parametrized too!
* *pytest* will automatically run every permutation of tests and fixtures
[source, python]
----
@pytest.fixture(params=[
  "sqlite:////tmp/foobardb",
  "mysql://foo@bar/database"
])
def db(request):
  return DatabaseConnector(request.param)

def test_select_works(db):
  assert db.select('foo').from_('bar')
----

== Unit testability and well factored code
* Working with legacy code = hard to unit test
** Usually not well factored
* Refactoring for unit testability = higher quality code

== Well factored code
* Isolate glue code (avoid complecting)
* Highly cohesive
* Loosey coupled
* Does one thing
